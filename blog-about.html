    Iâ€™ve never been the type of person to easily fit in any kind of box, and frankly,
    why would I ever want to do so? In my day to day life I am a writer, a teacher,
    a software developer, and a pho enthusiast. I am an avid learner and risk taker
     who loves to human culture and meeting new people. This blog is dedicated to
     showcasing my creative side, but will also feature some of the various technical
      projects I like to work on as well.
